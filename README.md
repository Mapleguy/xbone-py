# Xbone Py
Read an Xbox One controller in Python

This is based off things I've learned making a similar program before with a different method of reading inputs.
The "Inputs" module seems to be cross platform but I have not used it much nor tested this code on Linux yet.

The license for Xbone Py is MIT. Use it however you want.

Planned Features:
- Cross Platform Support
- Timeout and reconnect logic
- Integrated output (Via UDP, Serial, etc.)
- Asyncio for constant output rates without blocking
